            <p><em>Student At <strong><a href="https://abesit.in/"> Abes Institute of Technology</a></strong></em></p>
            <p>I am a student at <em>Abes Institute of Technology</em>, affiliated from <strong>AKTU </strong>University.My course specification is <em>Computer Science And Engineering</em>.<br> I love sketching too and having some great samples.Ever since I had written my first computer program in 11th class in C language, I am on a constant journey of learning new technologies and tools. Currently I m working in polishing my skills. I find my passion in coding and developing applications while listening to some good music. I like doing different projects and contribute in open source codes. I am always open for opportunities to speak in seminars or sessions and can deliver all the little knowledge I pursue.</p>
            <p>I like exchanging ideas & consider conversations as my hobby and so I enjoy being part of conversations over coffee on latest technologies and trends in IT industry, space and universe or regarding different projects and innovations. Lastly, I would like to connect to contribute!</p>
